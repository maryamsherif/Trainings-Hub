Instructions to add all the comments at one go:
1) Open a new tab in your browser.
2) Go to any URL, google.com for example.
3) Open devtools, using ctrl+shift+i or right-click -> inspect.
4) Navigate to console tab inside the devtools (Most probably, you will be in the elements tab already).
5) Copy and paste the below Js code in the console, then press enter.

Do not forget:
You must add the courses mock data first into the course database at your local computer.
The server should be running :)
